<h2> Parallel computation </h2>

The system of equations generated by FEM can often be quite large, involving millions of unknowns for the accurate representation of
the vasculature of an anatomical region. The numerical solution of such a large system typically requires it to be distributed onto
on a high-performance computational (HPC) cluster and solved in parallel. The svMultiPhysics solver uses Message Passing
Interface (MPI) library routines to automatically partition and distribute an FEM simulation to run in parallel on an HPC cluster.
